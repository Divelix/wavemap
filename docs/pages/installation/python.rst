We will make pywavemap available through PyPI soon. In the meantime, you can install it directly from source using pip.

If you only plan to use pywavemap without modifying its code, a regular install is easiest. However, if you are actively working on wavemap's C++ or Python libraries, we recommend using the editable installation method for fast, incremental rebuilds.

Regular install
***************
.. _python-install-build-deps:

First, make sure the necessary dependencies to build C++ and Python packages are available:

.. tab-set-code::

    .. code-block:: Debian/Ubuntu
      :class: no-header

      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install git build-essential python3-dev python3-pip
      sudo apt install python3-venv  # If you use virtual environments

    .. code-block:: Alpine
      :class: no-header

      apk update
      apk add git build-base python3-dev py3-pip
      apk add python3-venv  # If you use virtual environments

.. _python-install-clone-repo:

Next, clone wavemap's code to your machine:

.. tab-set-code::

    .. code-block:: SSH
      :class: no-header

      cd ~/
      git clone git@github.com:ethz-asl/wavemap.git

    .. code-block:: HTTPS
      :class: no-header

      cd ~/
      git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/wavemap.git

.. _python-install-setup-venv:

*Optional:* We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your Python dependencies. Create and activate it with the following commands:

.. tab-set-code::

    .. code-block:: Debian/Ubuntu
      :class: no-header

      sudo apt install python3-venv  # If needed
      python3 -m venv <path_to_new_virtual_env>
      source <path_to_new_virtual_env>/bin/activate

    .. code-block:: Alpine
      :class: no-header

      apk add python3-venv  # If needed
      python3 -m venv <path_to_new_virtual_env>
      source <path_to_new_virtual_env>/bin/activate

You can then install pywavemap by running::

    cd ~/wavemap/library/python
    pip3 install .

Editable install
****************
If you're interested in modifying wavemap's code, you can save time by enabling incremental builds.

The general steps are similar to those for a regular installation. Ensure your machine is :ref:`ready to build C++ and Python packages <python-install-build-deps>` and that you've :ref:`cloned the code <python-install-clone-repo>`. Optionally, you can :ref:`set up a virtual environment <python-install-setup-venv>`.

Since editable installs are no longer built in an isolated environment, all build dependencies must be available on your system::

      pip3 install nanobind scikit-build-core
      pip3 install typing_extensions  # Only needed for Python < 3.11

You can then install pywavemap with incremental rebuilds using::

      cd ~/wavemap/library/python
      pip3 install --no-build-isolation -ve .

When you change wavemap's code, the command above must manually be rerun to reinstall the updated package. For a more interactive experience, you can use::

      cd ~/wavemap/library/python
      rm -rf build  # Only needed if you previously built pywavemap differently
      pip3 install --no-build-isolation -Ceditable.rebuild=true -ve .

In this mode, code changes are automatically rebuilt whenever pywavemap is imported into a Python session. Note that the rebuild message is quite verbose. You can suppress it by passing ``-Ceditable.verbose=false`` as an additional argument to ``pip3 install``.
